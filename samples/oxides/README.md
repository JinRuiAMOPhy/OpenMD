# Metal Oxides in OpenMD
This Sample Library contains Metal Oxide compounds utilizing metals defined in the DR-EAM forcefield and oxygen.  This library contains a variety of compounds, both real and computed, that simulate multiple oxidation states for many of the metals.

All .omd samples contained were obtained from CIF files.
